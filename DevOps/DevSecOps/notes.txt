        * Dependencies used in the build
        * Frameworks
        * API's
    * Static Application Security Test (SAST)
        * Scaning the code developed by the developer to find all the vulnerabilities in the code

Sonarqube for testing SAST (testing code for vulnerabilities)
----  Installing docker in ubuntu
    * Make sure all the port are opened
    
    ``` 
        sudo apt update
        curl -fsSL https://get.docker.com -o get-docker.sh
        sudo usermod -aG docker ubuntu
    ```
    Exit and relogin to the system
    docker info --- to check the docker Installed
    ``` To install sonarqube using docker
        docker run -d --name sonarqube -e SONAR_ES_BOOTSTRAP_CHECKS_DISABLE=true -p 9000:9000 sonarqube:latest
    ```
    Connect to the port using port 9000
    ```
        http://ip_address:9000
    ```
    * Login to the portal with username "admin" password "admin"
    * Create Manual project or set up a DevOps platform configuration.
    * Test project locally or integrate with any CI 
    * Generate the token to test the code
    * Select the build and Copy the Scanner code generated
    * Download the project into the system
        git clone link
    Navigate to the folder containing pom.xml file
    * Execute the code generated by in the sonarqube portal
    * It takes time to Execute and the report generated will automatically shown in the portal
    * To scan another project create another in the portal
