### Software Composition Analysis(SCA)
* While developing code for any application, the developers use some frameworks or API's 
* These are called dependencies because the code written by the developer depends on these dependencies
* To make sure the complete application is secure we have to solve the vulnerabilities or security issues present in the dependencies
* To know the vulnerabilities presented in the dependencies we need to do SCA Scaning
* The report generated by the SCA tools will give an idea about the vulnerabilities in the dependencies
* By taking care of the vulnerabilities present in the dependencies makes the application more secure
*[Refer Here](https://www.synopsys.com/glossary/what-is-software-composition-analysis.html) for more info
* OWASP is one open source tool which is widely used to scan the dependencies
### OWASP Dependency check (SCA) 
* Install Dependency checker in ubuntu system
* OWASP requires java to get installed in the server
* Lets install java in the server
```
sudo apt update
sudo apt install openjdk-11-jdk -y
```
* Lets download the dependency check Software in the server
  * Before executing this command please go to the OWASP dependency check official website for the latest version and replace the url below with updated one
  * [Refer Here](https://owasp.org/www-project-dependency-track/) for the official website
```
wget https://github.com/jeremylong/DependencyCheck/releases/download/v7.1.2/dependency-check-7.1.2-release.zip
```
* We had downloaded a zip file to the server but to extract the zip file we need unzip package installed in the server
* Lets's install unzip
  * Before executing the below command replace "7.1.2" with the downloaded version
```
unzip ~/dependency-check-7.1.2-release.zip
```
* Now the OWASP has succefully installed in the server
* Let's create a folder to save all the projects
```
mkdir dependency-check
cd dependency-check
```
* Now download the repository to the server
* Replace the below url with the repository you want to scan
```
git clone https://github.com/wakaleo/game-of-life.git  
```
* Navigate to the folder where you want to save the report
* It's better to save in the downloaded project folder
  * If you have created new folder to save all the reports, then replace "game-of-life" with your folder name in the below command
```
cd game-of-life
```
* Replace ~/game-of-life/ with the downloaded project folder name where the pom.xml file is presented
  * Replace "Name" with the name of the project in the below command
```
~/dependency-check/bin/dependency-check.sh --project "Name" --scan ~/game-of-life/
```
* To view report in the command line 
```
cat ~/game-of-life/dependency-check-report.html 
```
* Reading the report in the command line is harder and not easier or user friendly
* To view the report from the local complete browser lets use apache2 server
* To install the apache2 server execute the following commands
```
sudo apt install apache2 -y
```
* To view the repots using apache2 the reports should be in the html folder
* Lets copy the report generated to the "/var/www/html/"
  * Replace "~/game-of-life/dependency-check-report.html" with the path of the report generated
  * Replace "report_name.html" with the name you want to give to your report
```
sudo cp ~/game-of-life/dependency-check-report.html /var/www/html/report_name.html
```
* Connect to apache2 using public-ip-address
    * Replace public-ip with the public ip of the server
```
http://public-ip/report_name.html
```
* The report generated will give information about all the vulnerabilities present in the dependencies used
* If there is any vulnerabilities matched with OWASP Top 10 then they need to be secured immediately
